and grow your business.

[Anchor to Marketing your app
externally](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#marketing-your-app-
externally)Marketing your app externally

Listing your app in the Shopify App Store is just the first step. After your
app is live, you can reach merchants through channels outside of the Shopify
community to promote your app and build trust with your users.

Driving traffic to your app from outside of Shopify can help improve your
app's ranking on the Shopify App Store. Also, if your app gets a significant
amount of outside traffic, then your app can be listed in the **Trending
apps** section on the app store's homepage.

Note

If you choose to make your app have [limited
visibility](/docs/apps/launch/distribution/visibility), then it won't show up
in Shopify App Store search results, category pages, or the **Trending apps**
list.

###

[Anchor to Webinars](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#webinars)Webinars

Hosting webinars is a great way to engage merchants who want to understand a
particular feature or ask any questions they might have about your app. You
can use webinars to show merchants new features or best practices for using
your app. Webinars can also help you build documentation for your app and
figure out issues and areas of growth for your app.

There are many tools that you can use to host your own webinars, including
[GoToWebinar](https://www.gotomeeting.com/en-ca/webinar), [Adobe
Connect](http://www.adobe.com/products/adobeconnect/apps/adobe-
connectmobile.html), or [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com). You
might also want to consider a service like [YouTube Live
Events](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2474026?hl=en), which will
record your webinar and save it for merchants who missed it or are looking for
a video tutorial.

###

[Anchor to Video tutorials](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#video-tutorials)Video
tutorials

You can reach a larger audience of Shopify merchants by publishing video
tutorials about your app. You can upload your tutorials to a service like
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) or [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) to have
them indexed on search engines for specific keywords. Video sharing services
will make your videos easily accessible by merchants and let you distribute
your videos across other platforms.

Videos can also easily be embedded into your documentation or your social
media, which can potentially be boosted for additional traffic. You can also
use videos in email marketing campaigns to show off new features.

###

[Anchor to Social media marketing](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#social-media-
marketing)Social media marketing

After you have created written content, recorded videos, and webinars, you
should consider distributing these materials through social media.

Social Media retargeting is a popular marketing technique that can help you
reach far more people than you could alone. You can use [Facebook
retargeting](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-reach-
existing-customers) to identify and target specific demographics of people who
might be interested in your app. Facebook will allow you to create an audience
that revolves around a specific target event that you want to occur. This can
help you drive engagement, get exposure to your app, or see merchants interact
with a specific feature in your app. You should be able to gain insights on
who has been viewing your online content and specifically target your
marketing efforts to those merchants.

You can use Facebook retargeting to create dedicated ads or even boost a post
within your actual Facebook page to reach an audience outside of your current
scope. You can choose to focus on increasing engagement, clicks to your link,
or awareness.

###

[Anchor to Email marketing](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#email-marketing)Email
marketing

Email marketing lets you stay in touch with your merchants and keep them
engaged. You can send emails about new features, or generate more traffic for
your webinars. You can also let your merchants reach you directly by email,
which can help increase trust and let you build relationships with your users.

Some services will let you collect email addresses from potential merchants,
so you can send them more information about your app. Facebook Ads also has
the ability to collect email addresses which you can import into these
services as part of your email marketing initiatives.

You can use email services like [AWeber](https://www.aweber.com/) to make
email marketing easier.

###

[Anchor to Engage with online communities](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#engage-
with-online-communities)Engage with online communities

Being active in external forums can help you access an audience with relevant
interests and skillsets. Participating in these forums allows you to build
relationships through continuous conversations, and interact with merchants
who might be interested in your app. Reaching out to communities in this way
can also help build trust with merchants.

Consider larger community groups like the [Shopify Community
forums](https://community.shopify.com), [Shopify
Blogs](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/topics/shopify-app-development),
or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), where you can actively engage with the
merchant community and provide value to them and their business.

[Anchor to Promoting your app in the Shopify
community](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#promoting-your-app-in-the-shopify-
community)Promoting your app in the Shopify community

After your app goes live, you can use several methods to promote it to the
Shopify community.

###

[Anchor to Using the Shopify Community
forums](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#using-the-shopify-community-forums)Using
the Shopify Community forums

You can promote yourself and your apps by creating value for merchants and
other Partners in the Shopify Community forums. Being an active member in the
forums and helping merchants solve issues will build trust with other members
of the Shopify community. You can also suggest your app to merchants if you
think it will help solve their issues. Participating in the forums can also
give you ideas for improving your app, or building new apps.

Note

Before using Shopify Community forums, make sure you're familiar with the
[Community Code of
Conduct](https://community.shopify.com/c/announcements/code-of-
conduct/m-p/491969#M23). Be mindful of promoting your app, as it might be
considered as spamming behavior.

###

[Anchor to Making a Partner-friendly app](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#making-
a-partner-friendly-app)Making a Partner-friendly app

Partner-friendly apps can be installed for free by other Shopify Partners.
This helps promote your app to other developers, as well as Partners who are
helping merchants to set up their store. If other Partners use your app and
enjoy it, then they can help promote your app to merchants.

To make your app Partner-friendly, you need to [offer free testing for
development stores](/docs/apps/launch/billing/offer-free-trials).

###

[Anchor to Making a freemium app](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#making-a-
freemium-app)Making a freemium app

Freemium apps are free to download, but offer merchants in-app purchases that
add extra features. Making a freemium app allows merchants to see how your app
can add value to their store before they pay. The merchant can then decide to
purchase your premium features. Offering a freemium app increases retention
over time and increases the initial install rate. After you've shown merchants
the value that your app can provide, you can consider transitioning your
freemium app to a paid app.

###

[Anchor to Improving your app listing](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#improving-
your-app-listing)Improving your app listing

A successful app listing will meet the needs of both of its two main
audiences: Shopify merchants and the Shopify App Store search engine.
Merchants read your app listing to understand the value of your app before
they decide to install it on their store. The Shopify App Store search engine
parses the information in your app listing to determine when to show your app
to merchants.

Note

Only [fully visible](/docs/apps/launch/distribution/visibility) apps appear in
Shopify App Store search results and category pages.

To learn about what kind of information you should include in your app
listing, refer to [Writing a Shopify App Store listing](/docs/apps/launch/app-
requirements-checklist). This guide explains how to prepare each section of
your app listing so that it appeals to Shopify merchants.

To improve your app listing for the Shopify App Store search engine, you can
try the following:

  * Fill out as many of the fields in your app listing form as you can, including optional fields.

  * Proofread your app listing to make sure that it doesn't have any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes.

  * Create a short list of keywords and key phrases to focus on in your app listing. The [Google Ads Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_ca/home/tools/keyword-planner/) is free to use and can help you generate ideas and suggestions. When you add keywords and key phrases to your app listing, they should flow logically with the rest of the content.

  * Make sure that you don't overuse the keywords and key phrases that you choose, since this can decrease your app's discoverability in the Shopify App Store.

  * Avoid using symbols in your keywords. For example, use "tshirt" instead of "t-shirt".

  * Use multiple common spellings and terms to increase your search index coverage. For example, you should optimize for both "popup" and "pop up".

  * Study on-page SEO to understand the basics of how search engines work, and learn how to apply them to improving your app's SEO on the Shopify App Store.

After you make changes to your listing, you can measure their impact by
tracking how many merchants install your app after reading the revised listing
on the Shopify App Store. You can also [track your listing traffic with Google
Analytics or Facebook pixel](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/track-listing-
traffic) to see how and where merchants are finding your listing in the
Shopify App Store.

###

[Anchor to Using merchant feedback](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#using-
merchant-feedback)Using merchant feedback

You can add positive feedback from merchants to your marketing material to
help promote your app. You can collect feedback from reviews on the Shopify
App Store, or by talking to merchants directly.

Getting positive reviews in the Shopify App Store can increase your app's SEO
and encourage new merchants to try your app. For more information about
reviews, see our guide on [managing app
reviews](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-reviews).

Caution

Never create fake reviews, or offer merchants incentives for leaving positive
reviews. If you do, then you'll be [removed from the Shopify App
Store](/docs/apps/launch/app-store-review/policy-violations).

###

[Anchor to Word-of-mouth marketing](/docs/apps/launch/marketing#word-of-mouth-
marketing)Word-of-mouth marketing

If merchants enjoy using your app, then they will be more likely to recommend
your app to other merchants. You can follow our [app
requirements](/docs/apps/launch/app-requirements-checklist) to improve your
app and provide good service to merchants using your app.
