# Collaborator accounts

Copy page MD

As a Shopify Partner, you can use collaborator accounts to access merchant
stores directly through your own Partner Dashboard or using the Shopify app.
Collaborator accounts give you access to only the sections of a store that a
merchant wants you to access, and don't count toward a store's [staff
limit](https://help.shopify.com/manual/your-account/staff-accounts). Any
stores that you have access to by using a collaborator account are labeled as
**Managed** stores in your Partner Dashboard.

If you're building or customizing a theme for a merchant, then you can use a
collaborator account with the **Themes** permission to create and manage
themes in the merchant's store.

* * *

##

[Anchor to Prerequisites](/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/collaborator-
accounts#prerequisites)Prerequisites

To request collaborator access to a store, you need a [Shopify Partner
account](https://www.shopify.com/partners).

* * *

##

[Anchor to Limitations](/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/collaborator-
accounts#limitations)Limitations

You need to log in to the store through the **Stores** section of your
**Partner Dashboard** instead of logging in directly to the store.

* * *

##

[Anchor to Request access](/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/collaborator-
accounts#request-access)Request access

If you want a collaborator account for a client's store, then you need to send
a request to the store owner through your Partner Dashboard. You can also send
your client [the Shopify Help Center page on collaborator
permissions](https://help.shopify.com/manual/your-account/staff-
accounts/collaborator-accounts/) to explain how collaborator accounts work.

If you already have a staff account for the client's store or have been
invited by the store owner to activate a staff account, but not yet activated
it, then your request for a collaborator account prompts the store owner to
update your current account permissions to reflect those of your collaborator
account.

As an additional layer of security, merchants can set up a 4-digit
collaborator request code for their Shopify store. When a store has the code
set up, you need to enter the code when you request access as a collaborator.
If you enter an incorrect code, then you see an error in the Partner Dashboard
and your request isn't sent to the merchant.

  1. From your Partner Dashboard, click **Stores**.
  2. Click **Add store**.
  3. In the **Store type** section, select **Managed store**.
  4. Enter the URL of the Shopify store that you want to access.
  5. If the Shopify store requires a collaborator request code, then enter the code.
  6. In the **Permissions** section, select the sections of the store that you want to access, or check **Full access**. The account owner can change these permissions after your account is created.
  7. If you want to include a message to the store owner in your request, then enter a message in the **Add a message** section.
  8. Click **Save**.

After you submit a request, the store owner receives an email about the
request and a notification on their Shopify Home.

[Anchor to Cancel a pending access
request](/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/collaborator-accounts#cancel-a-
pending-access-request)Cancel a pending access request

If you requested access to a store but need to cancel the request, then you
can do so through your Partner Dashboard.

  1. From your Partner Dashboard, click **Stores**.
  2. Beside the store with the access request that you want to cancel, click **Cancel request**.
  3. Click **Cancel access request**.

* * *

##

[Anchor to View your managed
stores](/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/collaborator-accounts#view-your-
managed-stores)View your managed stores

You can view the stores that you've requested access to on the **Stores** page
in your Partner Dashboard. There is no limit to the number of managed stores
that you can have, but you can have only up to 10 pending requests open at a
time.

If your access to a store is removed, then you can remove the store from your
Stores list by clicking **Remove from list**.

* * *

##

[Anchor to Manage access to a
store](/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/collaborator-accounts#manage-access-to-
a-store)Manage access to a store

Partner organizations often have access to multiple development stores and
managed stores, and have multiple staff members who perform different tasks in
the organization. To increase oversight over your staff members and maintain
merchant security, you can limit access to stores in your Partner organization
to only the staff members who need to access them. [Learn more about managing
access to merchant
stores](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/manage-
access).

* * *

##

[Anchor to Remove your access to a
store](/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/collaborator-accounts#remove-your-
access-to-a-store)Remove your access to a store

If you no longer need to work on a client's store, then you can remove your
access to the store. Removing your access deletes your collaborator account
from the store.

If you need to do more work on the store after you remove access, then you'll
need to request access to the client's store again.

After your access to a store is removed, you can remove the store from your
Stores list by clicking **Remove from list**.

  1. From your Partner Dashboard, click **Stores**.
  2. Find the store you want to remove your access from in the list.
  3. Click **Remove access** , and then click **Remove store**.

* * *

##

[Anchor to Expired access](/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/collaborator-
accounts#expired-access)Expired access

Collaborator access to managed stores remains active as long as a user logs
into the store at least once every 90 days. If there is no login activity
within this period, then Shopify will automatically expire the Partner's
access. If you need collaborator access after it has expired, then you can
[request access](https://help.shopify.com/partners/dashboard/managing-
stores/request-access) again through your Partner Dashboard.

* * *

[Anchor to Next steps](/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/collaborator-
accounts#next-steps)Next steps

  * [Create](/docs/storefronts/themes/getting-started/create) or [customize](/docs/storefronts/themes/getting-started/customize) a theme for the merchant
