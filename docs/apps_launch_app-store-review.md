# About the Shopify App Store

Copy page MD

With targeted recommendations and relevant categories, the [Shopify App
Store](https://apps.shopify.com) is the best place for Shopify merchants to
find apps that they can use to build their business. As an app developer, you
can create apps for the Shopify App Store to reach millions of entrepreneurs
around the world, and use Shopify's Billing API to create pricing models that
let you grow your own app development business.

Your App Store listing is the foundation for all app discovery. Whether
merchants find your app through browsing the App Store, receiving
recommendations in their admin workflow, or asking Sidekick for help, all
these experiences draw from your public App Store listing information
including your description, features, pricing, and reviews.

[Anchor to Improving quality and getting promoted](/docs/apps/launch/app-
store-review#improving-quality-and-getting-promoted)Improving quality and
getting promoted

Merchants want apps that are easy to use, safe, and performant, and that solve
their problems. To help merchants to find apps that meet their needs, Shopify
adds indicators of quality to apps, and promotes high quality apps on various
surfaces, including the Shopify App Store, in-admin, and Sidekick. Apps that
meet all of our criteria are given Built for Shopify status, our highest level
of recognition and achievement.

To learn about our quality standards, and how you can earn achievements that
grant you quality indicators and promotion opportunities, refer to [Built for
Shopify](/docs/apps/launch/built-for-shopify).
