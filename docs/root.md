cli/theme), and [headless storefronts](/docs/api/shopify-cli/hydrogen) in an

dependencies you need, including the CLI itself, so you can dive straight into
development.

Themes

  2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your theme.

  3. Run the second command to clone Dawn, Shopify's base theme, that you can build on top of. Your theme will be created in a new subdirectory.
