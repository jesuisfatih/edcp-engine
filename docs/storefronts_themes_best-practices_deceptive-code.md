# Avoid deceptive coding practices

Copy page MD

Deceptive development practices are prohibited on Shopify's platform. Shopify
expects app developers to act with integrity and in the best interests of app
users. Developers should regularly review, and remain compliant with, the
[Partner Program Agreement](https://www.shopify.com/partners/terms) and
Shopify’s [API Terms of Service](https://www.shopify.com/legal/api-terms).

The following sections describe some of the development practices that Shopify
considers deceptive. Any developer that uses these practices, or any other
practices considered by Shopify to be deceptive or harmful to merchants, is
subject to Partner governance action.

[Anchor to Obfuscating code](/docs/storefronts/themes/best-
practices/deceptive-code#obfuscating-code)Obfuscating code

Don’t obfuscate your code. Obfuscation means changing simple, straightforward
code into code that is difficult to understand. Obfuscated code obscures the
intended behaviour of the code, usually with the intention of hiding that
behavior from users. In addition, obfuscation techniques might also hinder the
performance of a user's site. There is no legitimate reason for developers to
inject obfuscated code into themes.

[Anchor to Manipulating search engines](/docs/storefronts/themes/best-
practices/deceptive-code#manipulating-search-engines)Manipulating search
engines

Themes shouldn't include any code that targets search engines to misrepresent
the site content. One example of this type of deceptive coding practice is
cloaking. Cloaking refers to the use of code that presents different content
to search engines than is presented to users.

Developers should never use any code that attempts to trick search engines for
any purpose, including increasing page speed scores.
