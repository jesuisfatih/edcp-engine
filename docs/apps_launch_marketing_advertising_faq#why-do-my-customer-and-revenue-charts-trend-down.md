# Ads FAQ

Copy page MD

As an app developer, you can [create
ads](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/create-ads) to help merchants
discover your apps in the Shopify App Store. Below are the most frequently
asked questions about ads in the Shopify App Store.

* * *

##

[Anchor to Running and displaying
ads](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#running-and-displaying-
ads)Running and displaying ads

This section covers questions about running and displaying ads on the Shopify
App Store.

###

[Anchor to Why doesn't my ad appear in search
results?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#why-doesnt-my-ad-appear-
in-search-results)Why doesn't my ad appear in search results?

There are some common reasons why your ad might not appear on a given search
results page:

  * Your bid for a keyword isn't high enough.
  * For search ads: your app is not relevant for the keywords that you're bidding on.
  * Your ad budget has been exhausted.
  * The computer used to access the search results is using a VPN (virtual private network).
  * The Shopify App Store is experiencing unusual traffic patterns, such as a high number of searches or homepage visits being made in a short period of time.

###

[Anchor to If I have 2 ads but they share keywords, which one wins the
auction?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#if-i-have-2-ads-but-
they-share-keywords-which-one-wins-the-auction)If I have 2 ads but they share
keywords, which one wins the auction?

They will enter the auction together, and one will be chosen based on the bid
and, for search ads, the relevance to the search.

###

[Anchor to Can I run ads in a language other than
English?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#can-i-run-ads-in-a-
language-other-than-english)Can I run ads in a language other than English?

Yes. Advertisers can bid on non-English keywords. If there are merchant
searches for non-English keywords, then ad impressions can appear. Accents and
special characters are stripped from ad impressions.

###

[Anchor to Do ads appear for merchants who have already installed the related
app?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#do-ads-appear-for-merchants-
who-have-already-installed-the-related-app)Do ads appear for merchants who
have already installed the related app?

No. If a merchant has installed your app, then they won't see an ad for it.
But if a merchant has uninstalled your app, then they will be eligible to see
your ad again.

###

[Anchor to Do ads show on shops that are not compatible with my app based on
the install requirements that I specified in my app
listing?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#do-ads-show-on-shops-
that-are-not-compatible-with-my-app-based-on-the-install-requirements-that-i-
specified-in-my-app-listing)Do ads show on shops that are not compatible with
my app based on the install requirements that I specified in my app listing?

No.

###

[Anchor to Is there a minimum
bid?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#is-there-a-minimum-bid)Is
there a minimum bid?

Yes. The system enforces a minimum bid. If your bid is below this minimum bid,
then your ad will not be displayed.

###

[Anchor to Is there a minimum
budget?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#is-there-a-minimum-
budget)Is there a minimum budget?

Yes. The minimum budget is $5.00 per day.

###

[Anchor to Can I run multiple ads for the same
app?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#can-i-run-multiple-ads-for-
the-same-app)Can I run multiple ads for the same app?

Yes.

###

[Anchor to Can my ads link to a page other than my app
listing?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#can-my-ads-link-to-a-
page-other-than-my-app-listing)Can my ads link to a page other than my app
listing?

No. Ads link to the app listing to make sure the merchants have a consistent
user experience within the Shopify App Store.

[Anchor to Paying for ads](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#paying-
for-ads)Paying for ads

This section covers questions about applying ad credits and alternative
methods of paying for ads.

###

[Anchor to Can I apply my ad credit to multiple
ads?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#can-i-apply-my-ad-credit-to-
multiple-ads)Can I apply my ad credit to multiple ads?

Yes. Your ad credit will be automatically applied to all of your currently
running search ads.

###

[Anchor to Will my credit card be charged if I spend only $40 out of my $100
of ad credit?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#will-my-credit-
card-be-charged-if-i-spend-only-40-out-of-my-100-of-ad-credit)Will my credit
card be charged if I spend only $40 out of my $100 of ad credit?

No. Shopify starts charging you for ads only after your full ad credit has
been applied to search ads.

###

[Anchor to Are there other ways to pay for
ads?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#are-there-other-ways-to-pay-
for-ads)Are there other ways to pay for ads?

###

[Anchor to Why are my customer and revenue metrics changing for any given date
over time?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#why-are-my-customer-
and-revenue-metrics-changing-for-any-given-date-over-time)Why are my customer
and revenue metrics changing for any given date over time?

You might notice customer and revenue metrics for a given date (for example,
June 1, 2020) increasing over time. This is due to the following factors:

  * Customer and revenue numbers are attributed to the date the impression was served.

  * Business models vary; those with deferred revenue will see more of this type of post dated updating of metrics.

For example, revenue for June 1 when you pull the numbers on July 1st might be
$0 because of free trials. Revenue for June 1 when you pull the numbers
October 1 might be $200 because merchants have had time to convert into paying
customers, upgrade their plans, and pay the subscription fee over a few
months.

For more complete results, we recommend looking at customer and revenue
numbers 60 days after the impression was served, and periodically checking on
older data to see if there has been additional revenue received.

The following sample charts illustrate a typical customer conversion rate and
return on ad spend chart for a recurring revenue business over time:

[Anchor to I was running an ad and earned money from a merchant upgrading
their plan on X day. Why do I see no revenue in my
reports?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#i-was-running-an-ad-and-
earned-money-from-a-merchant-upgrading-their-plan-on-x-day-why-do-i-see-no-
revenue-in-my-reports)I was running an ad and earned money from a merchant
upgrading their plan on X day. Why do I see no revenue in my reports?

We credit the customer / revenue conversion to the date the ad impression was
served, and not the date the merchant became a paying customer, or generated
revenue. Refer to What is impression date attribution?.

###

[Anchor to What is impression date
attribution?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#what-is-impression-
date-attribution)What is impression date attribution?

Impression date attribution is when we credit the customer / revenue
conversion to the date the ad impression was served, and not the date the
merchant became a paying customer, or generated revenue.

In the following example timeline, the date for all of the merchant's revenue
charges would be tied to June 1:

Event| Time  
---|---  
Merchant searches "marketing" and clicks on ad| June 1  
Merchant installs app| June 1  
Merchant upgrades and pays first app charge| June 30  
  
###

[Anchor to Why is attribution calculated using the impression
date?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#why-is-attribution-
calculated-using-the-impression-date)Why is attribution calculated using the
impression date?

Attributing customer and revenue data to the impression date ensures that
revenue is attributed to the activity that led to the customer conversion /
revenue event. It also allows advertisers to identify both the keyword that
the merchant came from, and the time that the merchant searched for the app.

With this information, advertisers can identify keywords that convert at a
high rate, and any patterns in conversion dates.

###

[Anchor to When do customer and revenue metrics stop
updating?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#when-do-customer-and-
revenue-metrics-stop-updating)When do customer and revenue metrics stop
updating?

Customer metrics stop updating when all possible merchants have converted to a
paid plan. Revenue metrics stop updating when all converted merchants have
stopped paying for the app.

###

[Anchor to How are customers
counted?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#how-are-customers-
counted)How are customers counted?

Customers are merchants who have installed your app and have paid for services
that resulted from an ad.

###

[Anchor to How is revenue
counted?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#how-is-revenue-
counted)How is revenue counted?

Revenue is counted as successful charges issued by you to the merchant. The
charges are attributed to an install that resulted from an ad.

###

[Anchor to Are churned customers factored into the customers
count?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#are-churned-customers-
factored-into-the-customers-count)Are churned customers factored into the
customers count?

No.

###

[Anchor to Are refunds factored into the revenue
number?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#are-refunds-factored-
into-the-revenue-number)Are refunds factored into the revenue number?

No.

###

[Anchor to Does the revenue figure factor in the revenue sharing
amount?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#does-the-revenue-figure-
factor-in-the-revenue-sharing-amount)Does the revenue figure factor in the
revenue sharing amount?

No.

###

[Anchor to How long of a delay can there be between the install and a customer
converting?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#how-long-of-a-delay-
can-there-be-between-the-install-and-a-customer-converting)How long of a delay
can there be between the install and a customer converting?

The total maximum potential delay is up to 64 days and any free trial period.
The timeframes are broken down as follows:

  * **Post-click install attribution window:** Up to 30 days delay
  * **Merchant monthly billing cycle:** Up to 29 days delay
  * **Reconciliation period by Shopify:** Up to 5 days

###

[Anchor to What dates are customer and revenue metrics available
for?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#what-dates-are-customer-and-
revenue-metrics-available-for)What dates are customer and revenue metrics
available for?

Customer and revenue metrics are available for ads that ran starting May 5,
2020.

###

[Anchor to Why do my customer and revenue charts trend
down?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#why-do-my-customer-and-
revenue-charts-trend-down)Why do my customer and revenue charts trend down?

That shape of chart is not necessarily a bad thing. This happens because you
pay for ads up front, but do not earn revenue until after the click or
install.

Refer to the questions Why are my customer and revenue metrics changing for
any given date over time? and What is impression date attribution? for why
your charts might look a certain way.

###

[Anchor to If a merchant converts to a paid plan months installing your app,
then will that be counted in the customer and revenue
metrics?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#if-a-merchant-converts-
to-a-paid-plan-months-installing-your-app-then-will-that-be-counted-in-the-
customer-and-revenue-metrics)If a merchant converts to a paid plan months
installing your app, then will that be counted in the customer and revenue
metrics?

Yes, as long as the merchant installed your app after clicking an ad.

###

[Anchor to If a merchant uninstalls and re-installs your app without clicking
an ad, then will the revenue earned from the latest install be counted towards
ad revenue?](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/advertising/faq#if-a-merchant-
uninstalls-and-re-installs-your-app-without-clicking-an-ad-then-will-the-
revenue-earned-from-the-latest-install-be-counted-towards-ad-revenue)If a
merchant uninstalls and re-installs your app without clicking an ad, then will
the revenue earned from the latest install be counted towards ad revenue?

No. Only revenue earned on the install attributed to ads is counted.
