# Go-to-market success

Copy page MD

After your app is [approved](/docs/apps/launch/app-requirements-checklist), by
default it will be [listed](/docs/apps/launch/distribution/visibility) on the
Shopify App Store. Shopify also features a selection of high-quality apps in
places like the Shopify admin and on the homepage of the Shopify App Store.

Here’s what you can do to help make sure your app is successful:

  * [Improve your app quality to become Built for Shopify](/docs/apps/launch/built-for-shopify). Apps that meet all of our criteria are eligible for Built for Shopify status. Along the way, you can qualify for smaller achievements that grant you more limited benefits, such as indicators of high quality on your app listing, special merchandising, or opportunities for promotion on various Shopify surfaces.

  * [Avoid prohibited actions](/docs/apps/launch/app-store-review/policy-violations) to make sure your app continues to be listed on the Shopify App Store.

  * [Market your app through Shopify](/docs/apps/launch/marketing) to reach merchants in the Shopify community.

  * [Use the Shopify App Store Ad Badge](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/shopify-brand-assets) in your advertising and on social media to increase merchant confidence in your app.

  * [Send out a press release](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/write-press-release) to announce the launch of your app.

  * [Manage reviews from merchants](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-reviews). Merchants can review your app in the Shopify App Store. Learn how to address feedback and work with negative reviews.

  * [Offer tech support](/docs/apps/launch/distribution/support-your-customers) for merchants who have issues or want to get more out of your app.

  * [Track usage of your app](/docs/apps/launch/distribution/track-app-usage) so that you have the data to help you make decisions and improvements.
