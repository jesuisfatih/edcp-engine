# Mobile support

Copy page MD

When you develop a mobile-first solution, consider the following mobile app
best practices.

* * *

##

[Anchor to Create responsive designs](/docs/apps/build/mobile-support#create-
responsive-designs)Create responsive designs

  * The app UI should adjust automatically to fit a smaller mobile screen to ensure a consistent experience on any device.
  * Prioritize vertical scroll over horizontal scroll, and avoid using any horizontal scrolling elements if possible.

* * *

##

[Anchor to Ensure core features are available](/docs/apps/build/mobile-
support#ensure-core-features-are-available)Ensure core features are available

  * The core functionality of the app or theme should be available using a mobile device.
  * Apps should notify users when features are not available on mobile.

* * *

##

[Anchor to Provide seamless setup](/docs/apps/build/mobile-support#provide-
seamless-setup)Provide seamless setup

  * Apps that require theme setup should use [theme app extension](/docs/apps/build/online-store/theme-app-extensions) [app blocks](/docs/apps/build/online-store/theme-app-extensions/configuration#app-blocks-for-themes) and [app embed blocks](/docs/apps/build/online-store/theme-app-extensions/configuration#app-embed-blocks) so that the user doesn’t need to manually make changes to their theme’s code.
  * Configuration and onboarding should be easy to follow and primarily take place inside the app.
  * Minimize the number of external web properties users are redirected to post installation.
