# User permissions

Copy page MD

Before creating apps and dev stores, you must first configure user permissions
for the Dev Dashboard.

* * *

##

[Anchor to Partner permissions](/docs/apps/build/dev-dashboard/user-
permissions#partner-permissions)Partner permissions

If you're a Partner, you'll configure access on the Partner Dashboard. Partner
users can be added to the partner organization either as an Owner or as a
Staff member. Owners automatically have full access to development tools, but
staff members need to have the following permissions explicitly assigned:

  * **Manage apps** : Enables users to create, edit, and delete apps.
  * **dev store access > Add, archive, and unarchive dev stores**: Enables users to create dev stores.

* * *

##

[Anchor to Merchant permissions](/docs/apps/build/dev-dashboard/user-
permissions#merchant-permissions)Merchant permissions

To give a user in your store access to the Dev Dashboard assign them the
**Apps Developer** role.

###

[Anchor to Custom roles](/docs/apps/build/dev-dashboard/user-
permissions#custom-roles)Custom roles

If your store is on the Plus plan you may also create a [custom
role](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/users/roles/manage-
roles#create-a-role). There are two permissions that can be assigned:

  * **Create and manage dev stores** : This permission allows users to create, edit, and delete apps. A user with this permission can edit all apps owned by the organization.
  * **Build and manage apps** : This permission allows users to create dev stores, but not production stores. Assigning this permission lets users create dev stores to build and test apps.

A role with both permissions will allow users to access all app development
features.
