# Manage app reviews in the Shopify App Store

Copy page MD

After a merchant installs your app, they can review it on the Shopify App
Store. Merchants rate apps on a scale of one to five stars, with the option to
add a comment about their experience.

Only merchants who have your app installed can leave a review. They can also
review within 45 days of uninstalling your app. You can reply to reviews to
add context. Both reviews and replies can be updated after publication.

[Anchor to Overall rating](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-
reviews#overall-rating)Overall rating

Shopify calculates an overall rating for your app, based on the reviews
merchants have left. The overall rating isn't simply an average of star
ratings; it's weighted to prioritize recent, useful, and trustworthy reviews.
Your app's overall rating updates dynamically as reviews are added or removed.

Our methodology emphasizes review quality over quantity. Merchants are more
likely to install apps with good ratings, while positive reviews make your app
appear higher in Shopify App Store search results and category pages.

###

[Anchor to AI-powered review summaries](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-
app-reviews#ai-powered-review-summaries)AI-powered review summaries

Some app listings feature review summaries powered by AI. These summaries help
merchants understand an app's value based on other merchants' experiences.

To qualify for an AI-powered review summary, your app needs at least 100
reviews containing body text, and at least a 4.0 rating. Review summaries
aren't updated in real time. They can take up to 14 days to appear on your app
listing.

[Anchor to How to ask for an app review](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-
app-reviews#how-to-ask-for-an-app-review)How to ask for an app review

You can ask merchants to review your app as long as you use neutral language
and don't incentivize the request. Here's an acceptable example:

_**" We value feedback! It helps us make our product better and keeps us
energized. Let us know how we're doing."**_

Asking for positive reviews, or incentivizing reviews, violates [Shopify's
review policies](https://help.shopify.com/partners/faq/reviews) and [Partner
Program Agreement](https://www.shopify.ca/partners/terms). See How not to ask
for an app review.

###

[Anchor to Best practices](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-
reviews#best-practices)Best practices

To appropriately ask for an app review, consider these guidelines:

  * **Include in-product messaging when and where it makes sense** : Don't interrupt workflows or block merchants from taking actions in your app to display a review request. This might make merchants feel like they _have_ to leave a review to continue using the app.

  * **Ask for reviews following a support interaction** : Merchants might appreciate the care you've put into helping them, and be willing to share their experience.

  * **Allow merchants to say no to requests to leave reviews** : After asking a merchant for a review once, give them the option to not be asked again.

* * *

##

[Anchor to How not to ask for an app
review](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-reviews#how-not-to-ask-for-an-
app-review)How not to ask for an app review

Never explicitly ask for positive reviews, or incentivize merchants to add,
edit, or remove reviews. Manipulating reviews in these ways violates
[Shopify's review policies](https://help.shopify.com/partners/faq/reviews) and
[Partner Program Agreement](https://www.shopify.ca/partners/terms).

The following examples illustrate some inappropriate requests for reviews:

  * _**" Like our service? Leave us a positive review!"**_: This only motivates merchants with a favorable perception of your services.
  * _**" Get one month free by leaving us a review!"**_: If you're giving a merchant something for free, then you're influencing them to leave a positive review.
  * _**" Positive feedback keeps us going! Help by leaving a review now!"**_: This suggests that the review should only be positive.

* * *

[Anchor to Replying to app reviews](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-
reviews#replying-to-app-reviews)Replying to app reviews

Replying to app reviews can help you identify issues, engage with merchants,
and give them a more favorable experience with your app. Replying to reviews
can also show other merchants how engaged you are, which can encourage them to
install your app. Check out our [blog post on best practices for replying to
reviews](https://www.shopify.ca/partners/blog/reply-to-reviews).

###

[Anchor to Steps](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-reviews#steps)Steps

You can reply to app reviews if you're an account owner or if you have a staff
account with the [**Manage public listings**
permission](https://help.shopify.com/partners/dashboard/account-access).

  1. Log in to your [Partner Dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/organizations).
  2. Click **Apps**.
  3. Click the app you want to view.
  4. On the app page in the **Latest merchant feedback** section, click **View and reply to reviews**.
  5. Go to any review and click **Reply**. If you don't see the review you're looking for, then click **View all reviews** to see more reviews.
  6. Enter your reply, then click **Submit reply**.

###

[Anchor to Notifications](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-
reviews#notifications)Notifications

When a merchant leaves a review on your app, you'll receive an email
notification. This email contains the merchant's store name, their star
rating, and the review content.

You can set which email address receives review notifications in [the
**Contact information** section of your app listing](/docs/apps/launch/app-
requirements-checklist#h-contact-information).

When you reply to a review, the merchant who left the review is notified. They
can then decide to edit their review, including the star rating.

You'll receive an email notification when a merchant edits their original
review. You can edit your response at any time, even if the merchant hasn't
updated their review. Only your latest response is displayed on the app
listing page.

##

[Anchor to Managing negative reviews](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-
reviews#managing-negative-reviews)Managing negative reviews

Negative reviews can be helpful to identify issues with your app. They can
also be an opportunity to showcase your willingness to problem solve and help
merchants use your app effectively. Merchants will appreciate a thoughtful
reply to negative feedback.

If a merchant leaves a negative review because of a bug or other issue, then
you should work with the merchant to fix the issue. If you are able to resolve
the issue, then you can ask the merchant to consider updating their review.
This request should never be forceful or attached to an incentive.

If a merchant leaves a negative review containing information you disagree
with, then the best course of action is to respond and seek to understand
their feedback. You can also use your reply to share your perspective on the
matter, in a respectful way.

###

[Anchor to Circumstances where Shopify will
intervene](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-reviews#circumstances-where-
shopify-will-intervene)Circumstances where Shopify will intervene

Sometimes, reviews are fake, incentivized, or non-compliant with our policies.
In these circumstances, we'll intervene and potentially edit or remove reviews
from app listings. We'll investigate reviews that include the following:

  * **Inappropriate content** : The review contains swearing, slurs, or threats.

  * **Personal information** : The review contains phone numbers, email addresses, mailing addresses, or other personal information. We won't remove reviews that contain only a first name, or a first name and a last initial.

  * **Conflict of interest** : The review was written by a merchant who was offered something in exchange for a review. We'll also remove reviews left by app developers and affiliated employees on either their own app or on a competing app.

  * **Duplication** : The review has been posted multiple times, whether from the same account or more than one account.

If you find a review that meets any of the criteria above, then you can
[report it](https://www.shopify.com/legal/tools/report-an-issue/report-a-
partner-violation). For the privacy of all parties involved and the security
and integrity of the Shopify App Store, we aren't able to discuss the outcome
of these investigations.

[Anchor to Archived and unpublished
reviews](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-reviews#archived-and-
unpublished-reviews)Archived and unpublished reviews

Shopify continuously evaluates all reviews on the Shopify App Store for trust,
quality, relevance, and timeliness. To help merchants make the best decisions
when selecting apps, we sort reviews to prioritize recent feedback from
trusted, established merchants that contains meaningful, high-quality detail.

###

[Anchor to Archived reviews](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-
reviews#archived-reviews)Archived reviews

Reviews are **archived** if they're left by stores that are on a trial or
discounted plan, or that are no longer active. Once the store has paid for a
full priced plan, its reviews get unarchived.

Your app's 50 most recent archived reviews are visible on the Shopify App
Store, on the last page of reviews. Archived reviews don't count toward your
app's review total or its overall rating.

Because a review's archived state is determined by the store's account status,
we don't accept appeals for archived reviews.

###

[Anchor to Unpublished reviews](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-
reviews#unpublished-reviews)Unpublished reviews

Reviews are **unpublished** if they don't meet our trust and quality
standards. This includes, but is not limited to, reviews that are fake, spam,
incentivized, or otherwise non-compliant with [Shopify's review
policies](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/help-support/faq/reviews).

Unpublished reviews aren't visible on the Shopify App Store, and they don't
count toward your app's review total or its overall rating. If you believe a
review was unpublished incorrectly, you can [appeal the
removal](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/help-support/faq/reviews#what-
if-i-think-one-of-my-reviews-was-removed-incorrectly).

##

[Anchor to Prohibited actions involving app
reviews](/docs/apps/launch/marketing/manage-app-reviews#prohibited-actions-
involving-app-reviews)Prohibited actions involving app reviews

The following actions are prohibited and can lead to consequences including
your non-compliant reviews being removed, your app's ranking being demoted,
removal from promotional surfaces, or becoming unpublished from the Shopify
App Store.

Learn more about [Shopify's policies for App Store
reviews](https://help.shopify.com/partners/faq/reviews) and the complete list
of [prohibited actions on the Shopify App Store](/docs/apps/launch/app-store-
review/policy-violations).

Prohibited action| Description  
---|---  
Asking for positive reviews| Asking for positive reviews creates a bias in
your call-to-action and goes against Shopify's [Partner Program
Agreement](https://www.shopify.com/partners/terms).  
Sending unsolicited emails that ask for reviews| This practice is in violation
of several spam legislations, such as the [Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation
(CASL)](https://fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/eng/home) and [CAN-
SPAM](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-
compliance-guide-business) in the United States. It's also in violation of
Shopify's [Partner Program Agreement](https://www.shopify.ca/partners/terms).
Ask merchants if they want to receive emails from you and make sure you're
asking at a moment that makes sense for them.  
Compelling merchants to edit or revise negative reviews| Constructive reviews
provide helpful feedback on how you can improve your app. Never retaliate
against a merchant for leaving honest negative reviews. If a merchant leaves a
negative review related to an issue they've had with your app, and you work
with them to resolve it, then you can ask them to consider updating their
review. This request should never be forceful or attached to an incentive.  
Posting or paying for fake reviews on your own app or another app| Never
attempt to boost your sales by creating fake reviews that deceive merchants.
You should also never post or pay for fake reviews on a competitor's app to
create a competitive advantage.  
Incentivizing merchants to leave reviews| Don't offer a discount or other
benefit in exchange for leaving a review.  
Asking for reviews at an inappropriate time| Merchants can't provide a genuine
review of your app if they haven't spent enough time with it. Don't ask for
reviews when a merchant is onboarding or installing your app. Give the
merchant time to create an informed opinion before they provide a review.
